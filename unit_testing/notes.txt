# Notes on Unit Testing

## Use one of the naming convetions:

	-test_script.py  (all test scripts will be matched together)
	-script_test.py  (each individual script will be matched with its testing script)

## Run unit test script in two ways:

	-python -m unittest 		 (Python identifies the unit test scripts)
	-python -m unittest test_script  (Specifying the testing script that we wrote)
